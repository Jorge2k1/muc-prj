# Music University Coaching (MUC)

## Overview

Music University Coaching (MUC) is a web-based platform designed to bridge the gap between aspiring music students and professional coaches. The platform supports students in overcoming mental barriers, enhancing their confidence, and preparing for prestigious university auditions while providing visibility and opportunities for coaches. The project is focused on improving accessibility to coaching and resources tailored to the needs of musicians at various stages of their educational and professional journeys.

## Features

- **Student and Coach Accounts**:
  - Students can register to access resources, explore universities, and connect with coaches.
  - Coaches can showcase their expertise and offer guidance to students.

- **University Database**:
  - Provides detailed information on universities, including tuition costs, scholarships, and admission requirements.

- **Personalized Coaching**:
  - Students can search for coaches specializing in specific universities or skill sets.
  - Coaches can attach their profiles to university pages to attract students.

- **Communication Tools**:
  - Direct chat functionality to facilitate real-time communication between students and coaches.

- **Dynamic User Profiles**:
  - Both students and coaches can customize their profiles with relevant information and achievements.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for user interface design.
  - Bootstrap for responsive layouts and styling.

- **Backend**:
  - Node.js and Express.js for server-side logic and API creation.

- **Database and Authentication**:
  - Firebase for real-time database management, user authentication, and file storage.

- **Version Control**:
  - Git for managing source code and versioning.

- **Development Environment**:
  - Visual Studio Code as the primary IDE.

## Architecture

The platform is built on a client-server architecture to ensure scalability, modularity, and real-time functionality. Key components include:

1. **Client-Side**:
   - Responsible for rendering the user interface and handling interactions.

2. **Server-Side**:
   - Manages authentication, business logic, and communication with the database.

3. **Database**:
   - Stores user data, chat messages, and uploaded files securely.

## How It Works

1. **Registration**:
   - Users sign up as either a "Student" or "Coach" and create personalized profiles.

2. **Connecting with Universities**:
   - Students can explore a curated list of universities and save their favorites.
   - Coaches can associate their profiles with specific universities to gain visibility.

3. **Finding and Contacting Coaches**:

## Development Methodology

The project followed a **User-Centered Design (UCD)** approach, involving:

1. Identifying user needs through interviews and surveys with music students and coaches.
2. Creating detailed user personas to guide feature development.
3. Prototyping and iterating on designs based on user feedback.
4. Testing the final product with real users to validate its usability and effectiveness.

## Future Improvements

Planned enhancements include:

- Integration of video conferencing for live coaching sessions.
- Advanced search filters for students to find coaches based on specific criteria.
- Expansion of the university database with additional institutions and programs.
- Gamification elements to motivate users and track progress.
